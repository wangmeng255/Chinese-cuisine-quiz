## Background

I built this app drawing on my love of Chinese Cuisines. I want to introduce China's 8 great regional cuisines to people in the all world. 

Summary of the Eight Cuisines:
* Sichuan and Hunan cuisines: hot spice.
* Anhui and Fujian cuisines: inclusion of wild foods from their mountains.
* Guangdong (Cantonese), Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu: great seafood, and generally sweet and light flavors.
* Shandong Cuisine: fresh and salty with a lot of seafood dishes.

## Use Case

You can get a rough concept and regions of eight Chinese Cuisines by this simple quiz.

## Functionality

The app's functionality includes:

* An introduction for Chinese cuisines quiz.
* A China map showing Chinese eight great regional cuisines.
* Introductions to eight great cuisines.
* Finding one dish among three dishes belongs to the cuisine asked in questions.
* Showing quiz results and restarting quiz.

## Technical

The app is built entirely in jQuery. All data is held in memory during the user's session. It has been built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop screen resolutions.

## Development Roadmap

This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:

* Extending the app to show more cuisines in China (e.g. Beijing, Dongbei etc).
