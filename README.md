##Background

I built this app drawing on my experience from buying a home in California. The school district is an important factor that influences value of the home. I want to compare home value in two school districts, especially when two school districts have similar education ratings. And I also want to get trending of home prices in one school district.

##Use Case

Why is this app useful? If you are struggling to get recent value and trending of home prices in a unified school district in California, this app allows you to get data directly from U.S. census collections and provides a chart to help you to get trending of prices.

##Initial UX

The initial mobile and desktop wireframes can be seen below:

##Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: (https://wangmeng255.github.io/API-Hack/)

##Functionality

The app's functionality includes:

* Analysis of home value of 78 unified school districts returned by U.S. census.
* A California school districts map to show the location of the selected districts.
* Selecting two unified school districts in California or one unified school district in two different years.
* Reseting selected districts by clicking reset button.
* A column plot of home prices of two different school districts or home prices of one school district in two different years (2012-2014).

##Technical

The app is built entirely in jQuery and makes use of AJAX calls to U.S. census collections API to return the data. All data is held in memory during the user's session. It has been built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop screen resolutions.

##Development Roadmap

This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:

* Extending the app to analyse home price data of elementary school and high school districts which is offered by U.S census API.
* Extending the app to analyse home price data of school districts in more years which is offered by U.S. census API.
* Extending California school district map to include elementary and hight school districts.
